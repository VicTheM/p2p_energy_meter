# Smart Meter and P2P Server Repository

Welcome to the Smart Meter and P2P Server repository. This repository contains the codebase for a smart metering system and a peer-to-peer (P2P) server designed to enable the sharing of domestically generated power. The code is primarily written in C and Python.

## Introduction

The smart metering system is designed to monitor and share domestically generated power, such as solar or wind energy, within a community. It provides users with real-time insights into their energy production and consumption while facilitating the efficient distribution of excess power through a P2P network.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of energy production and consumption
- Sharing of excess domestically generated power within a community
- Secure data transmission between smart meters and the server
- Peer-to-peer communication for decentralized energy sharing
- Detailed usage and production reports and analytics
- Written in C for performance-critical components
- Python scripts for data analysis and visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE v2.x.x
- Python 3.x
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-meter-p2p-server.git
   cd smart-meter-p2p-server
   ```

2. **Compile and upload using the Arduino IDE**
   ```sh
   cd meter
   ```

4. **Set up the web server**
   ```sh
   cd ../web
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd web_flask
   python app.py
   ```

### Data Analysis and Visualization (coming soon)

Python scripts for data analysis and visualization can be found in the `analysis` directory. To generate a report, run:

```sh
cd analysis
python generate_report.py
```
