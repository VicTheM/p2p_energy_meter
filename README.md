### Hi Eunice
If you ever see this (yeah, you are seeing it now) take your time and read gently. Do you like stories? Everyday I come to push an update I could leave a story behind for you to read. Well, that's just me starting humorously.
The personal message I wish to convey is don't push yourself too much. Shortly, I would define tasks that I hope to be done by you, but even if you don't find time to do it, that's OK, a time would come you will have all the time in the world to
do all you wish, just focus on your priority and be content with whatever you are able to do.<br>
On the other hand, by the grace of God I will be able to do as much as is required so we won't be lacking in anything.<br>
***Enjoy your weekend...***
