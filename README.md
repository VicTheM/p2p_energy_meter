# Smart Meter and P2P Server Repository

Welcome to the Smart Meter and P2P Server repository. This repository contains the codebase for a smart metering system and a peer-to-peer (P2P) server designed to enable the sharing of domestically generated power. The code is primarily written in C and Python.

## Introduction

The smart metering system is designed to monitor and share domestically generated power, such as solar or wind energy, within a community. It provides users with real-time insights into their energy production and consumption while facilitating the efficient distribution of excess power through a P2P network.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of energy production and consumption
- Sharing of excess domestically generated power within a community
- Secure data transmission between smart meters and the server
- Peer-to-peer communication for decentralized energy sharing
- Detailed usage and production reports and analytics
- Written in C for performance-critical components
- Python scripts for data analysis and visualization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Python 3.x
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-meter-p2p-server.git
   cd smart-meter-p2p-server
   ```

2. **Build the C components**
   ```sh
   cd smart_meter
   make
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Smart Meter

To run the smart meter code, navigate to the `smart_meter` directory and execute the compiled binary:

```sh
cd smart_meter
./smart_meter
```

### Running the P2P Server

To start the P2P server, navigate to the `p2p_server` directory and run the server script:

```sh
cd p2p_server
python server.py
```

### Data Analysis and Visualization

Python scripts for data analysis and visualization can be found in the `analysis` directory. To generate a report, run:

```sh
cd analysis
python generate_report.py
```
